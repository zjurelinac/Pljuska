                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Hash is a simple and easy-to-use scripting language. It's syntax
                        and commands are quite similar to other UNIX scripting languages,
                        so if you've ever used any of them, say Bash or Zsh, you'll
                        find Hash familiar and understandable.</p>
                        <p>The documentation is divided in two parts. <a href = "#first">The first</a>
                        deals with basic language syntax and features, while <a href = "#second">the
                        second</a> contains a short description and usage examples of every command
                        supported by Hash.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class = "content-section" id = "first">
                        <h3>Language overview</h3>
                        <p>Here is a short overview of Hash language characteristics and features.
                        It's separated into smaller paragraphs, each describing one of the core
                        elements of the language.</p>

                        <h4 id = "syntax">Syntax</h4>
                        <p><b>Hash language</b> script consists of a <b>series of statements</b>,
                        which can be either <em>commands, assignments or control statements</em>.
                        Statements are most often separated by newlines, though semicolons <code>;</code>
                        can serve the same purpose.</p>
                        <p class = "caption">Here is an example of a short script:</p>
<pre><code><span class = "comment"># For each month, create a directory for notes</span>
<span class = "cmd">cd</span> <span class = "param">Documents/Bussiness</span>
<span class = "var">$i</span> <span class = "op">=</span> <span class = "val">1</span>
<span class = "ctrl">while</span> <span class = "op">[</span> <span class = "var">$i</span> <span class = "op">&lt;=</span> <span class = "val">12</span> <span class = "op">]{</span>

<span class = "op">}</span>
</code></pre>

                        <h4 id = "datatypes">Data types</h4>
                        <p>Hash supports two separate data types: integers and strings, whereby
                        string values must be enclosed into double
                        quotes, <code>&quot;like this&quot;</code>. Integer values
                        support all the basic arithmetic operations: <em>addition, subtraction,
                        multiplication, division and modulo</em>. Integer
                        values are limited to the interval of <code>&lt;-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup>&mdash;1&gt;</code></p>

                        <h4 id = "variables">Variables</h4>
                        <p>Variables in Hash can be of either string or integer type, but it's
                        type is changeable during program execution. Variables are always
                        identified by preceding a <code>$</code> symbol in front of their name.
                        Variable names can contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, digits and
                        an underscore symbol <code>_</code>.</p>
                        <p class = "warning">Beware though,
                        some variable names are reserved for special purposes, like <code>$0</code>
                        which contains the script name, and <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>..., where
                        script arguments are automatically stored. Accidentally overriding their values
                        could influence the behaviour of other functions. &ndash; <b>Not implemented yet</b></p>

                        <h4 id = "arithmetic">Arithmetic</h4>
                        <p>Integer data type in Hash supports all basic arithmetic operations: <b>addition</b>
                        <code>+</code>, <b>subtraction</b> <code>&mdash;</code>, <b>multiplication</b><code>*</code>,
                        <b>division</b> <code>/</code> and <b>modulo</b> <code>%</code>. Their behaviour is the same
                        as almost everywhere else: they're all associative, and multiplication, division
                        and modulo have higher priority than addition and subtraction.
                        There is also an unary <code>-</code> operator, which behaves as expected.</p>

                        <p class = "warning">Unary minus should be enclosed in parentheses together with the term it applies on,
                        because otherwise there is a possibility of parse errors.</p>

                        <p>You can also use parentheses to group certain terms and override operator
                        precedence, should you require to do so.</p>

                        <p class = "caption">A few examples of arithmetic expressions:</p>

                        <h4 id = "conditions">Conditions</h4>
                        <p>Conditions in HASH are created from simple comparisons between values and
                        variables, such as <code>$a >= 7</code>, which are combined using operators <b>and</b>
                        <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <b>or</b> <code>||</code> and <b>not</b> <code>!</code>, together with
                        parentheses. They're allowed only inside control statements, where their evaluation
                        to either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> determines how will the script
                        execution proceed.</p>

                        <h4 id = "control">Control statements</h4>
                        <p>Hash supports two types of control statements: <b>if&ndash;else statements</b> and
                        <b>while loops</b>. Both test a given condition, and based upon it determine
                        what to do next.</p>
                        <h5>If&ndash;else statement</h5>
                        <p>A given condition is tested, and if it evaluates to <code>True</code>, first
                        block is executed, otherwise the second is, if there is one.</p>
